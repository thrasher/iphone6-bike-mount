iPhone6 in-case Bike Mount
===========
This iPhone6 bike mount is designed to fit around a cased-iPhone6.  This allows for use of the mount, without removing the iPhone from it's existing case, thus making transitions from on-bike riding, to work, much faster.  The phone stays in it's case the whole time, yet is visible while riding if needed.

## 3D Printing Instructions 

The OpenSCAD file has three parts that must be printed separately:
- lower case, that conforms to the bottom of the cased-iPhone6
- upper case, that clips the iPhone in
- stem mount, that zip-ties to the bike's handlebar stem

Use the .scad file to print each piece by commenting out the other parts, creating an .stl for each one.

The included .stl for the three parts together is only for illustration purposes.

## Fitment

The iPhone-in-case dimensions specifically fit a Yahoo-branded case.  This just happened to be the one that I had at the time.  Adjust the parameters as needed, and do a test print for other cases.
